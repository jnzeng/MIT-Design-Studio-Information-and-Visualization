"(Numbers in thousands. Households as of March of the following year. A.O.I.C. stands for alone or in combination. Median income and Gini indexes are calculated using $2,500 income intervals. Beginning with 2009 income data, the Census Bureau expanded the income intervals used to calculate medians and GiniÂ’s to $250,000 or more. Medians falling in the upper open-ended interval are plugged with $250,000. Before 2009, the upper open-ended interval was $100,000 and a plug of $100,000 was used)"
