        <img class="col-md-12" style="height: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px" src="initial%20sketch.jpg"/>

        <p class="col-md-12">My initial sketches started from two questions:
1)	What is weather?
2)	What user want to know about weather?
Based on these two questions, I quickly sketched some ideas. The first idea is to show the back view of a human profile. The layers of the cloths are determined by the temperature, to show the user what to wear today. There will be another graphic layer/filter of the actual weather: for example, if it’s snowing, there will some white dots on the shoulder. The second concept uses a similar representation, but with human’s body hair. The next two concepts (selected for future development) will be explained in the following section.

        <h2 class="col-md-12">Refined Concept 1</h2>

        <img class="col-md-12" style="height: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px" src="1.jpg"/>

        <p class="col-md-12">The circle in the middle of the canvas is both the “sun” and an “object”. The “sun” represents lighting condition – from light to dark. The user can check on the hourly weather by sliding on/rotating the “sun” (so the color and pattern of the sun will change). As an “object”, the shape of the circle is dynamic and changing based on the weather variables: for example, for windy condition, the circle will be an irregular shape based on the wind strength; if it is rainy, there will be another layer of animated rain on top of the circle (subtract the circle). Since the circle does not merely mean the “sun”, I used unconventional color – pink for the sunlight and purple for the night (still close to the lighting). This design gets rid of the traditional weather icon. I designed a weather icon library based on the variables: so if it is windy and rainy, the weather layer will be rain drops (lines) in a certain angle (defined by the wind speed and direction).  </p>

        <p class="col-md-12">The second concept is customizable and can be integrated with lock screen. Basically, the interface is a view of looking at an art work through a piece of glass. The user can tell the weather through what they see in the glass. The whole interface responses to time: it looks darker at night. Ideally, the user can customize any picture/artwork behind the glass, or their own photos, or a picture of an object they like.</p>
